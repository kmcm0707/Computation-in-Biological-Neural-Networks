# Predictive Coding
Predicative Coding != Predictions
neural response: prediction error = input - prediction
Abbot - works for scalars
Simple Hierarchical model - Example EM algorithm - for linear gaussian model.
0-Tempreture EM - approximate posterior as delta function is very bad.
$y_L = - \mu y_L (leak) + A_{L+1}y_{L+1}  + Wy_L + A_{L-1} y_{L-1}$.
One paper: Trains prediction of model compared to optimal (from BPTT).
