# Cerebellum
- Degradation causes motor skills to degrade
- Makes internal predictions.
Forward Model - predicts sensory, Inverse Model - predicts

80% neurons, 3 layer of cortex, 4 deep nuclei.
Only really feedforward, no mutually excitory recurrent circuits, only inhibitory.

200 million mossy fibres -> 40 billion granule cells (dimensionality expansion) -> 15 million purkinjie cells -> deep nuclear cells -> motor cortex.
Also have climbing fibres with strong input to purkinjie cells.

Marr-Albus-Ito theory

## A Vector Calculus for Neural Computation in the Cerebellum
Imprecise purkinjie cells output moves eyes accurately.
Null Space Hypothesis - many neurons converging on downstream target - only average neural activity must resemble muscle activity.

P (purkinjie) cells have simple spikes (normal spike) and complex spikes (have a frequency) -caused by climbing fibers.
