All data comes from a computable generative process
Church-Turing thesis: all models of computation are equivalent - just offset by a constant (now say shorter programs are higher weighted - universal prediction problem).
Solomonoff's universal probability distribution.
Kolmogorov complexity: length of shortest program that outputs x.
Neural networks can model this undlying probility distribution.
