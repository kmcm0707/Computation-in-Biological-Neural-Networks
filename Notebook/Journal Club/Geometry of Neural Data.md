# Geometry of Neural Data
Non-linear mixed selectivity is good.
Neurons are:
Purely selective - only selective to 1 task variable.
Linear Selective - linear to both variables.
Non-Linear - non-linear relation to task variables = higher dimensional mapping.
High dimensional representations improves behavioural performance.
