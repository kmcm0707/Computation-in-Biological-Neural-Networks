# Lecture 6 - Non-Parametric Few-Shot Learning
Mainly for classification models - probably need to read up on embedding.
[[cs330_nonparametric_2022.pdf]]
Can we embed a learning procedure without a second-order optimization?

## Non-parametric Methods

$l_2$ doesn't work:

Label 1: If same class.
Siamese network - have 2 inputs and pass into exact same neural network.
![[Pasted image 20241014172238.png]]
Basically pass image into Siamese and compared to each image and check which one it thinks is closest.
But meta train and meta test are different as meta test time is all at once instead of one by one - meta test time equation: ![[Pasted image 20241014172553.png]]
So can instead backpropagate through this equation but get rid of $>0.5$ as can't differentiate: ![[Pasted image 20241014172648.png]]
Which is analogues to this:
![[Pasted image 20241014173503.png]]
Basically bit before the $X$ is embedding space and $X$ is multiple. (Bi-directional LSTM can be replaced by bi-directional transformer).
So basically meta-train and meta-test happen at same time.
